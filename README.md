# Django-html-completioner

An VS Code extension provides variable completion when editing django-html

## Features

Would you like to know what variables are provided by `views.py` when editing django-html?
Parse `views.py` and search for the third argument of the function `render`.
And adds the provided variable name to the completion list.
If the file you are editing is not defined in `views.py`, you can jump to the file from the popup message.
